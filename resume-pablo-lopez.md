- Created modules using their custom framework built on top of ASP.NET for specific clients.

- Added Web Api to reduce full-page postbacks in several commonly used pages.
- Added Knockout.js to several commonly used pages to provide a better user experience.
- Edited database queries and columns to get faster results. Some of these enhancements helped the customer's client to get much more work done in less time.

### [Nearsoft](https://nearsoft.com/) - [MDLive, Inc.](https://www.mdlive.com/) <small>September 2015 - August 2019</small>

- Created a WebRTC client for the web using Icelink's Javascript library and React.
- Created a WebRTC client for C# to use for audio recording.
- Installed and set up infrastructure for WebRTC, signaling, STUN, and TURN servers.
- Integrated WebRTC clients into Ruby on Rails websites so patients and providers with supported browsers could have their online appointments without having to install any third-party software to support video and audio conferencing.
- Integrated Office 365 login with UWP application.
- Created a Ruby gem to map request/response JSON messages from applications to Surescripts XML API. This enabled developers to work with known tools like ruby and json and not having to worry about extra complexities when accessing Suresctipts api.

> MDLIVE is a telehealth provider focused on digital delivery of high-quality, convenient, and cost-efficient medical care. The company provides patients, health plans, health systems and self-insured employers with 24/7/365 access to board-certified doctors, pediatricians and licensed therapists via secure online video, phone or a smartphone app.

When I started working with MDLIVE their providers for videoconferencing were VSee and Adobe Connect. This was the challenge, to start using an open source provider, instead of a third party vendor that sometimes had connectivity issues and costly licenses. I replaced the third party providers with the new Web RTC one. The change was made from scratch for the web version of MDLIVEConnect. The new option was also native in most browsers, giving users the possibility of using it without any additional downloads and software installs. Once the product was finished for modern browsers, support for IE was added. I also supported the teams in charge of the iOS and Android versions. MDLive was now able to use MDLiveConnect as its primary video conferencing and reduced costs by minimizing the amount of licensing fees.

MDLive is based in Sunrise, Florida.

### [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) - [American Mortgage Consultants](https://www.amcfirst.com/) <small>January 2013 - September 2014</small>

- Created a tool to create due diligence tests to loans using ASP.NET Web API and Knockout.js.
- Created a component to manage loan stipulations using ASP.NET web services and Knockout.js.
- Added a new section for claims review.
- Migrated code from ADO.NET to using .netTiers data access.

> American Mortgage Consultants (AMC) is a leading nationwide due diligence and consulting services provider with offices in New York, Tampa, Denver, Des Moines, Farmington Hills (Detroit), and Vernon Hills (Chicago). With a market leading team of mortgage professionals, AMC can create solutions for both large and small clients.

When I started at AMC they were required to build forms from excel sheets that company personnel printed out and manually filled during due diligence. They handed me about 7 different sheets to get started but a first wave of little over a hundred variations was on the way. It would have taken ages for me to build forms for all of them so I instead built a tool for them to build their own tests which anyone could use.

Then I was tasked to create a component to include in a section of their internal web application that displayed Loan Stipulations with some search features. All I was handed was a few database table names, some UI specs, a warning that pretty much no one in the dev department fully understood the requirements and a contact name to reach out if help was needed. That contact was rarely available and I never got answers to my questions so I started documenting every assumption I made and was able to continue development based on almost only assumptions. After three months of delivery I was congratulated because the feature was sent to production without passing through QA, was widely used and no bugs had been reported.
