### Alteryx <small>- via Toptal</small>

Aug 2020 - Jan 2024

Implemented accessibility guidelines, requirements and screen reader support on flagship desktop and cloud products, enabling users of assistive technologies to manipulate, modify, move and perform any other possible actions using only the keyboard within workflow diagrams and navigate to other parts of the applications. Also allowing power users to manage their workflows much more quickly by not having to click and drag. Simply making tools compliant is not sufficient which lead to some code refactoring and partial redesign of tools to make them more useful and intuitive for better usability and user experience.

* Added keyboard navigation, manipulation and screen reader support to workflow diagrams components which at the time no one else had and did not exist on the market using C# and Windows Forms.
* Updated, refactored and developed custom accessibility objects for in-house and third-party Windows Forms components to enable screen reader support and keyboard navigation improving usability and overall user experience using C# and Windows Forms.

* Updated and refactored custom components to better integrate accessibility features and keyboard navigation using Javascript and React.
* Updated and created new user interface automated tests using C# and White Framework.
